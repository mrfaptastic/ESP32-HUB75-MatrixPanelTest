# ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanelTest
A simple project to be able to change the Output Enable and Latch timings on the fly and see the result using a hacked copy of the MatrixPanel I2S library.

This project is standalone, no external libraries required. 

This project is for a specific reason only, and is useless for everyone other than those interested in: https://github.com/mrfaptastic/ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA/issues/75
